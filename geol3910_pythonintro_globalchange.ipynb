    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "All elements consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Elements are defined by their *atomic number*, the number of protons contained within their nucleus, such as Oxygen, whose atomic number is **8**. Often, elements can exist with the same atomic number, but a different number of neutrons. An atom with the same atomic number, but a differing number of neutrons, is defined as an **isotope**. Often, isotopes are radioactive and cause atomic decay. Carbon 14 $^{14}C$, for example, is Carbon 12 with two extra neutrons, leading it to have an atomic mass of 14. $^{14}C$ is radioactive and decays into Nitrogen 14 via [Beta Decay](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/isotopes/decay.html#:~:text=C%20decays%20by%20a%20process,rather%20than%20a%20carbon%20atom.). Atoms with differing numbers of neutrons that are *not* radioactive are called stable isotopes. $^{13}C$, for example, is a stable isotope of carbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because stable isotopes of a given element have differing weights, they are often termed \"light\" or \"heavy.\" This weight difference is often small (just the weight of one or two neutrons), but can be significant enough to cause changes in the reaction characteristics of molecules, especially when a reaction is mediated by biological enzymes. These differing reaction rates often lead to one isotope being preferentially reacted when compared to the other - this is known as **stable isotope fractionation**. Often times, but not always, biological systems \"prefer\" the light isotope of a given element, due to it having faster reaction kinetics than its heavy counterpart. In shorthand, scientists will often say \"life prefers light.\" The result of this is that one can often search for the source of a compound of interest by looking at its isotopic composition *i.e.* does the isotopic composition of our compound of interest match that of a biological system or that of an abiotic reaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commonly Studied Stable Isotopes\n",
    "A few commonly studied stable isotopes in biogeochemical systems are:\n",
    "- $^2H$ : Deuterium, stable isotope of Hydrogen $^1H$\n",
    "- $^{13}C$ : Carbon 13, stable isotope of Carbon $^{12}C$\n",
    "- $^{15}N$ : Nitrogen 15, stable isotope of Nitrogen $^{14}N$\n",
    "- $^{17}O$ : Oxygen 17, stable isotope of Oxygen $^{16}O$\n",
    "- $^{18}O$ : Oxygen 18, stable isotope of Oxygen  $^{16}O$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta Notation\n",
    "Stable isotope fractionation is often written out using \"delta\" ($\\delta$) notation. Delta notation is a ratio of ratios, where the ratios are those of one isotope to another. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta = \\frac{R_{sample} - R_{standard}}{R_{standard}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_{sample}$ is the isotope ratio of the sample and  $R_{standard}$ is the isotope ratio of an international standard. In the case of Carbon, a common international standard is VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite).\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta notation is often expressed in \"permil\". Similar to percent, delta values can be converted to permil by multiplying by 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta \\space in \\space permil: = \\frac{R_{sample} - R_{standard}}{R_{standard}} * 1000\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Consider the made-up element *Bozium* that has two isotopes of heavy and light. What is the delta value of a sample whose istotope ratio (heavy/light) is .25, compared to an international Bozium standard that has an isotope ratio of .1?"
